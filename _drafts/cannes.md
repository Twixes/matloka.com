This brief, unapologitecally pretentious essay was my submission for the [Three Days in Cannes](https://www.festival-cannes.com/en/take-part/accreditations/#3joursacannes) program in 2025. TopicNo luck this time – and I suspect no Cannes Film Festival person ended up giving it a read, as I submitted fairly late by accident. Let it not go to waste though!

> ### The Substance of Film
>
> The 2024 instant cult classic “The Substance” puts flawed reality in conflict
> with perfect illusion. It's a fascinating story told boldly, and for me, that
> theme is what film is fundamentally all about:
>
> Cinema's all fake when a triple-A Broadway adaptation. Still fake when a
> gritty indie file. Facsimile at best when a documentary.
>
> A filmmaker never sets
> out to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. In service of
> the story, you sculpt a new reality out of the rough marble of our real world.
> Sometimes uncomfortably familiar, sometimes entirely unrecognizable.
> In this way, every frame of a motion picture is the most divine thing there is:
> _a fleeting feeling_.
>
> And every sculpture takes sweat and blood to create. A film is a work of a
> thousand chisels, every cast and crew member being one. Within months of
> production starting, a factory floor of people is hard at work, collectively
> trying to put lightning in a bottle. Together, they form a filmmaking machine,
> where even the auteur is a just a part. You make it by making do, with on-set
> grit, creative thinking, long hours. Like in shooting “The Substance”, your
> Los Angeles is actually just around the corner from Cannes, in Antibes.
> In this way, every frame of a motion picture is the greasiest thing there is:
> _a unit of industrial output_.
>
> Yet I'm not disillusioned when I see how the lightning was put in a bottle. I'm
> impressed all the more, knowing that human drive has yet again pushed the
> boundaries of what's believable. Without the greasy, there would be no divine.
