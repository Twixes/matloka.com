The European Buddhist Union (EBU) is the umbrella organization of Buddhist communities and national Buddhist unions in Europe. The EBU is open to all schools and traditions of Buddhism in Europe wishing to unite on the basis of Buddhist teachings and work together in spiritual friendship and respect for diversity. According to the 'EBU Statement of Mission and Vision'[1] the aims are to facilitate international exchange and promote spiritual friendship amongst European Buddhists, to support social action and ideas motivated by Buddhist values, and to amplify the voice of Buddhism in Europe and worldwide.

History of the EBU
The EBU was founded in London in 1975, at the initiative of Judge Paul Arnold.[2] The first Annual General Meeting (AGM) was held the same year in Paris.

Thus, the EBU is almost exclusively a representational organization of convert Buddhists, although some migrant Buddhist organizations are affiliated with national unions.

Today the political authorities of most European countries have come to some form of official recognition of Buddhism.[citation needed]

Participation in international organisations
In 2008 the EBU obtained official participatory status with the Council of Europe in Strasbourg and participates in the Council of Europe's Conference of International Non-Governmental Organisations.[6] In June 2014, Michel Aguilar (representative of the EBU to the Council of Europe) got elected chair of the Human Rights Committee[7] for a three-year term of office. The Human Rights Committee brings together some 160 NGOs. Topics that ar
