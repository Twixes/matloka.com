You don't have a software product if you have no user. And you don't have a user if you have no user interface.Logically then, user interface design matters. How your product works for your users

Let me begin with a strong, maybe crass, but fundamentally true statement:

As a maker, good design is your moral imperative.

Whether you are making a website, mobile app, kitchen appliance, or a building. You can feel when you're using a delightful invention or a shoddy piece of crap. Your users can too.

For some people design is their lifeblood, and _modus operandi_.

- Empathy
- Abstractions
- Taste

I think this is actually pretty similar across UI design and systems architecture: The question is "What's the right abstraction for this component, and how does this call site fit in with other instances of this abstraction?" Except in backend systems this is rarely a matter of correctness and mostly of maintainability. With user interfaces wrong abstractions actually hurt the user experience (I mean, this LGTM thing is just a gimmick, but this equally applies to buttons, forms, landing pages, or anything really)
