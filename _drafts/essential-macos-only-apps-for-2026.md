It's been almost 3 years since my legendary (_ha, wish_) post on [Essential macOS-only apps for 2023](/blog/2023-02-06-essential-macos-only-apps-for-2023). A lot has changed in the macOS world – so much that I can no longer share the 2023 piece with friends in good conscience. Then, some things have stayed the same.

It's time for a v2 of the list, or as Apple would now say: a v26.

## 1. [IINA](https://iina.io/)

_Free and open-source._

## 3. [Swish](https://highlyopinionated.co/swish/)

_$16, adjusted to cost of living. Time-limited trial available._

Just like Rectangle, Swish brings effortless window snapping to macOS. What's the difference? This solution is based on trackpad gestures: Swipe up with two fingers on a window's titlebar, and the window will be maximized. Swipe right, and it will take up the right half of the screen. Double-tap, and it will go back to its original size, while also being centered. That's just a few of the possibilities – there are also gestures for moving windows between spaces, minimizing, tiling into quarters or sixths, and more. It's a surprisingly intuitive workflow if you use the trackpad often, and honestly I now prefer it over Windows-style dragging to edges. This is quicker _and_ more powerful.

## 4. [UnnaturalScrollWheels](https://github.com/ther0n/UnnaturalScrollWheels)

_Free and open-source._

Swish was all about the trackpad, UnnaturalScrollWheels is all about the mouse. In particular, it fixes two annoying "features" of macOS:

1. When using a mouse, you traditionally move down the page by _scrolling down_ physically – while when using a trackpad, it's more natural to move down the page by _swiping up_ (like on a touch screen). Apple has made this impossible - it's either "all movement down scrolls down", or the opposite.
2. Mouse acceleration can't be disabled. Acceleration makes a whole lot of sense on the relatively small trackpad, but limited sense with a whole _desk_ to work with. I much prefer my mouse movement to be reflected 1:1 on the screen.

This app provides the settings to make your mouse work exactly the way you'd expect.

## 5. [Dato](https://sindresorhus.com/dato)

_$8. Unlimited trial available._

"We live in a twilight world" was the phrase used throughout _Tenet_, the 2020 movie by Christopher Nolan. This certainly referred to the fact that in 2020 it suddenly was twilight before you managed to finish all the Zoom meetings for the day, not having worked even a single productive hour.

Now 2020 is water under the bridge, but the Zoom meetings have stayed with us (and hopefully they're actually useful). Dato helps you manage all of them by putting the day's schedule in the menu bar, along with a handy calendar. Anything planned for the next three hours? One click to find out! What about March 17 – what day is that even? Click "Next month" within the same menu - Calendar.app begone! Got a meeting just about to start? Use the instant "Join" button, no need to fish for links!

The cherry on top is that you can make Dato a drop-in replacement for the built-in date+time menu bar item, which is what I've done above. Looks _exactly_ the same as the system indicator, except it's useful when you click it!

> By the way, Dato is a tool by Sindre Sorhus, whose code you're certainly using already! He's extremely prolific as a developer and has authored [many useful macOS apps](https://sindresorhus.com/), but also [dozens of popular packages used by other software](https://github.com/sindresorhus?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=&sort=stargazers).

## 6. [Hand Mirror](https://handmirror.app/)

_Free. Paid upgrade available._

On the topic of meetings… Those first five seconds of every call are the worst. Your face is either weirdly small or all-encompassing, and you realize you forgot to switch the lights on. What if you could just get a quick preview beforehand? With Hand Mirror you can, any time. It's a mirror in your menu bar, simple as that.

The $5 Hand Mirror Plus upgrade comes with a few extra customization options (window positioning, choice of menu bar icon) but I love one in particular: Click _behind the MacBook notch_ for the mirror to pop up! Neat AND intuitive.

I work in software, so I often find myself recording the screen to share some software in action. [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) is handy when I want to also record myself talking, but that's overkill most of the time. Meanwhile, the built-in Screenshot.app only records QuickTime MOVs, which lack universal support. A simple GIF is usually all that's needed.

Gifox is a screen recording tool that reliably delivers – you'll never guess – GIFs. It's really handy, although its unique advantage is compression. GIFs are notoriously large as a trade-off for compatibility, but Gifox's outputs as optimized as a GIF can get, far surpassing even what ImageOptim can do!

## 10. [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/)

The BitTorrent protocol is world-famous for its widespread use in the Linux community, where installation images are shared left-and-right completely in line with copyright law. Mysteriously, it seems like a significant drop in peer-to-peer activity coincided with the rise of streaming services such as Netflix and Spotify… I consider myself part of the trend, yet occasionally there's still some content (those _niche distros_) that remains very hard to find outside of torrents.

This is where Transmission, the BitTorrent client, comes in. The app was first released for OS X 10.4 in 2005 and almost 18 years later the open-source project is still going strong. As opposed to the closed-source μTorrent, Transmission is free of ads and cryptocurrency miners, and its streamlined UI reigns supreme over qBittorrent's clunky experience. Since 2005 the app has gone multi-platform, but its UI and messaging clearly is still macOS-first, so I'm happy to include it here.
