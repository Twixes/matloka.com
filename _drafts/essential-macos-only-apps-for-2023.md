title: Essential macOS-only apps for 2023

macOS has a vibrant ecosystem of apps you won't find anywhere else. Most of them are good software, making life easier in some way… but some are real gems. Over the years I've found a handful of those – tools that I now find indispensable. There's no reason to keep this collection to myself, so here's my top 10 as of 2023:

## 1. IINA

*Free and open-source.*

IMHO the best video player ever built. It is extremely versatile in terms of media formats supported – quite like VLC – but also sports a sleek macOS-native design – *unlike* the traffic cone player. It's completely free, both as in beer and as in speech. To me, it's a demonstration of what free software can look like in combination with Apple's "It just works" ethos.

## 2. Rectangle

*Free and open-source.*

If I could bring *just one* feature of Windows into macOS, it'd be window snapping, no doubt about that. It's really baffling why that still isn't built-in (and somehow something like Stage Manager is), but fortunately there are many good solutions to this problem, all thanks to independent developers. A few of these are Magnet, Mosaic, or Divvy, but Rectangle definitely is my favorite - it simply allows you to resize windows by dragging them to edges of the screen, just like in Windows… And that's it. As opposed to most other solutions, Rectangle is free

## 3. Swish

*$16, adjusted to cost of living. Time-limited trial available.*

Przyciąganie okien, ale gestami na trackpadzie.

## 4. UnnaturalScrollWheels

*Free and open-source.*

Dodatkowe kontrolki kierunku przewijania i wyłączenie przyspieszania kursora. IMO obowiązkowe jeśli używa się myszki.

## 5. Dato

*$8. Unlimited trial available.*

Pełny kalendarz w menu barze, bardzo przydatny do śledzenia spotkań w ciągu dnia i szybkiego dołączania.
