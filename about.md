**When I was wee, I loved to spend my time assembling LEGO sets.** What thrilled me even more was building new things out of bricks from _disassembling_ sets. Then one day, I deleted shell32.dll from the family Windows XP PC.

It was at that moment I realized computers are much closer to LEGOs than magic.

**These days, I assemble software products, full-stack.** As a software engineer, I believe in:

1. understanding the user
2. building the right solution for their problem
3. productizing that solution

**Currently a product engineer at [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) (YC W20), [I lead the PostHog AI team](https://posthog.com/teams/posthog-ai).** I joined at seed in 2020, the day I finished high school finals. In those pre-revenue days – and PostHog Cloud didn't even have a paid plan yet – $1B seemed like a pipe dream. Turns out scouring the HN "Who is hiring?" thread is worth it, if you can back it up with actually building!

In building PostHog AI, I'm focused on agents for actionable product research. Between the topics of LLM orchestration, context engineering, evals, or agentic user interfaces – it's still the early days of LLMs, and the landscape moves fast.

**To be honest, I can't stop myself when the urge to build a side project hits**. Take a look at my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Twixes) for the full collection.
