**When I was 7, I always looked forward to the next new LEGO set to assemble.** But what I loved even more was building a new contraption out of all the bricks I had from _disassembling_ sets. Then one day, I deleted shell32.dll from the family Windows XP PC.

It was at that moment I realized computers are much closer to LEGOs than magic.

**These days, I assemble software at [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) (YC W20), [where I lead the PostHog AI team](https://posthog.com/teams/posthog-ai).** I joined at seed in 2020, the day I finished my high school finals. In those pre-revenue times – no paid SaaS plan even – $1B seemed like a pipe dream. It turns out scouring the HN "Who is hiring?" thread _is_ worth it, if you can back it up with actually building!

**As a product engineer, I believe in:**

1. understanding the user
2. building the right solution for their problem
3. productizing that solution

**Currently focused on agents for actionable research.** Between the topics of LLM orchestration, context engineering, evals, or agentic user interfaces – it's still the early days of LLM-powered products, and the landscape moves fast.

**There are too many things I'm passionate about outside of tech.** Juggling them is a challenge:

* photography – [see my Unsplash profile](https://unsplash.com/@matlokam), I live and die by the Sony RX100
* travel – alternating between cities, towns, mountains, and shores, my long–running goal is to visit every European capital; currently at 26 out of 44
* architecture – the built environment around us shapes our consciousness; return to ornamentation and classical motifs
* urbanism – just like architecture, only at a higher level of abstraction; build walkable cities for humans, not cars
* cinema – there's no bad genre, there are only bad screenplays
* music – soundtracks in particular; the piano is the superior instrument
* cycling – not only the best way to get around any sane city (i.e. European), it's also fun
* industrial design – often undervalued, it rules our every day, whether it's the push/pull door, the device you're reading this on, the Google results page, or your notes app
* astronomy – I was an astrophysics nerd before I realized software is cool too _and_ has real career prospects
* progress studies – how did humanity's output skyrocket in the last two centuries, and how do we keep the cycle of technological progress going?
* VC – I'm looking for European success stories, both founders and headquarters (EU–INC LFG); but [VCs Congratulating Themselves](https://x.com/VCBrags) never gets old
* LEGO – still! big fan of Icons, Ideas, Architecture

**And I can't stop myself when the urge to build a side project hits**. Take a look at my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Twixes) for the full collection.
