There's a trap that growing product-focused companies fall into: you start confusing *glue teams* with *back-office teams*, and if you aren't careful, you'll build an org that optimizes for fluffy internal goals. But what's just as bad: in a desperate fear of internal goals, you can accidentally kill real value.

Let me explain.

## Respect the hustle (while it's there)

In the early days of a startup, there's clarity. You've got a tight team. Everyone builds the product. Everyone's customer-obsessed. *Everyone's* scrambling for product-market fit.

These are the golden days: the org chart is more like a flat circle with a post-it note saying "build something people want". Nobody's arguing about ownership, and when hordes of users want to pay the [SSO tax](https://sso.tax/)? One of you just *ships it*.

But then you grow.

You hit 30 people. Then 50. Then 100. And the org chart starts to creak. Areas need to be split up for ownership. Some bits get chopped up nice and clean, others become murky waters. Here's where the confusion begins.

## Two types of teams, worlds apart

As you scale, you'll hear calls for two kinds of horizontal teams. They look similar. They're not.

**Back-office teams** serve other teams. Period. Their customers are on the same payroll. Like the back office of a bank, customers never see them. They build developer tools, maintain component libraries, run data platforms.

The thing about back-office teams: they're always one layer removed from real impact. They make tools that help people who help users. They improve processes that improve productivity that (hopefully) improves the product. There's that layer of indirection. An inevitable loss of context. Blink, and that team just spent weeks solving an elegant internal problem with minimal impact.

**Glue teams** serve users. Directly. They just happen to work horizontally.

Auth? Glue. Not flashy. Not a standalone product line. But it keeps the product together in one piece. It makes or breaks entire deals by itself – or a user's day.

Billing? The ultimate glue. Money, systems, UI, all in one.

These aren't back-office functions. They're product teams that happen to cut across features instead of owning vertical slices. They talk to users. They own product metrics.

## Resist the urge

Here's the uncomfortable truth: you can get away without back-office teams much longer than you think, and you should.

When building something new, the space of *possible* moves is infinite. The set of moves needed for success? Surprisingly small. It's all about separating what matters from distractions – and distance from users is a recipe for pure distraction.

I know. Engineers are complaining about CI. Everyone's clamoring for better internal tools.

Tough love: at 50 people, distributed ownership solves this smoothly. Agency is all it takes: one person improves the dev environment as a side quest, someone else maintains the component library between feature work. It's not their full-time job, and it shouldn't be yet.

At 100, ideas for supporting teams start rolling in left and right. Still, keep those zero degrees of separation from customers. No game of telephone. No ivory tower solutions. No platforms built in a vacuum.

Start thinking of true back-office teams well beyond a headcount of 100, when you can honestly call the internal engineering effort a rounding error. Till then – a little bit of chaos is valuable. It teaches what problems actually matter.

## The bottom line

Create glue teams when users are suffering - often earlier than you think. Create back-office teams when the ROI is undeniable - much later than you think.

Keep building things people want.
